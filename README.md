<p id="description">This project is a simulation study that evaluates the performance of a multiprogrammed server using the Omnet++ simulation framework. The study identifies the most relevant factors that determine the server's throughput and simulates the system under different configurations. It provides a valuable resource for computer engineering students and professionals interested in understanding how to evaluate the performance of a multiprogrammed server using simulation tools. The complete study is in the <a href="https://github.com/mirawara/Multiprogrammed-Server/wiki/MS-Wiki">Wiki</a>.</p>

  
<h2>🧐 Study steps:</h2>

 * Define the system model and its components, including the processor, disk, web server, and clients. 
 * Use of factorial analysis to identify the factors that can affect the server's throughput, including the number of clients, service rates of the processor, disk, and web server, and probabilities of request forwarding and reply sending. 
* Use the Omnet++ simulation framework to simulate the system under different configurations and evaluate its performance. 
* Analyze the simulation results using an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to identify the most relevant factors that determine the server's throughput.
* Validate the hypothesis by performing a t-test on the ANOVA results.
* Evaluate the system's performance by analyzing its utilization and response time under different scenarios.
